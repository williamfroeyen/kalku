Kalku is a static website that provides 119 different calculators. It is built with HTML5, CSS3 and native JavaScript. The project achieved successful monetization with Adsense and can be viewed at kalku.no


## Motivation and Development:
* **Project timeline**: I started developing this website in December 2024. Most of the calculators were added between January and October 2025. 
* **Use of documentation**: The code was written by me, with the aid of MDN docs, W3Schools and StackOverflow. No AI-generated code was used.
* **My motivation**: My motivation for this project was to get better at front-end development. 


## Technologies Used: 
* **Front-end development:** HTML5, CSS3 and native JavaScript. 
* **Logo creation:** Photopea
* **Favicons:** RealFaviconGenerator


## Calculator Logic:
* **Real-time calculation:** All the calculators feature real-time calculation on input, removing the need for a separate “calculate” button. 
* **Floating-point precision:** The calculators use Number.EPSILON for precision when  rounding floating-point numbers. 
* **Code scalability:** The calculators share mostly the same highly-reusable code, which made adding new calculators a fast and easy process. 


## UX and Design Decisions:
* **Mobile-responsiveness:** The website looks good and works well on mobile devices.
* **Hyperlinks that stand out:** All the links of the website stand out with a green colour and change colour on hover.
* **Chunking:** The links on the homepage are grouped in pairs to make it easier to search for and find the right calculator.
* **Easy internal navigation:** Each calculator has links to other similar calculators. 
* **Intuitive input:** The border around the input fields changes colour when selected. 
* **Switching units:** Many of the conversion calculators have a button to switch the units with an icon that is easy to understand. It changes colour on hover.

* Calculator page (liter to gallon) on computer:

## SEO:
* **Schema markup:** Most of the calculators have FAQ schema-data, where the data on some of the pages were utilized by Google’s AI-summary, resulting in increased visibility.
* **Meta description testing:** The calculators all have a meta title and meta description. When Google first indexed the website, it tended to ignore the meta description for the description under the calculators, which contained examples and formulas. After experimenting with different descriptions, I found that showing an example of a conversion at the beginning of the meta description, like 1 inch = 2.54 cm, made Google prefer the meta description. I could then add keywords like easy, precise or fast and a call to action to the rest of the description. 
* **Alt tags:** Every photo on the website has a descriptive alt tag.
